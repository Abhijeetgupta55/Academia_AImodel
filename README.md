## AI Academic Certificate  Authenticator
# 📌 Overview

The AI Certificate Verifier is a tool designed to detect fraudulent or forged academic certificates using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), OpenCV image analysis, and machine learning models.

The system identifies signs of tampering such as:

- Font mismatches

- Inconsistent text alignment and spacing

- Editing hotspots (regions where modifications are likely)

- Signs of image manipulation from editing software

- Noise and artifact analysis

# 🛠️ Features

- OCR Extraction using pytesseract

- Preprocessing with OpenCV (thresholding, denoising, contour analysis)

- Forgery Detection using handcrafted + AI-based techniques

- Noise & Artifact Analysis

- Modular Pipeline (easy to extend with new detection techniques)

# 🧪 Example Usage
```
from src.main import run_verification

result = run_verification("data/sample_fake.pdf")
print(result)
# Output: {"status": "fraudulent", "reasons": ["Font mismatch", "Editing hotspots detected"]}
```
# 📊 Sample Results
The verifier outputs results in a tabular format summarizing each certificate’s tampering status, score, and details of anomalies detected.
